# SMOTE-application
At times, we deal with highly imbalanced datasets to analyze. In such scenarios, the performance of any analysis algorithm is dominated by the features which are present in  high number. Hence we balance the datasets by sampling and one such balancing technique is SMOTE which is a kind of oversampling
